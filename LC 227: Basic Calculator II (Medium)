LC 227: Basic Calculator II (Medium) 

Given a string s which represents an expression, evaluate this expression and return its value. 

The integer division should truncate toward zero.

You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of [-231, 231 - 1].

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "3+2*2"
Output: 7
Example 2:

Input: s = " 3/2 "
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: s = " 3+5 / 2 "
Output: 5
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105
s consists of integers and operators ('+', '-', '*', '/') separated by some number of spaces.
s represents a valid expression.
All the integers in the expression are non-negative integers in the range [0, 231 - 1].
The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

class Solution:
    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:
        s=s.replace(" ", "")
        stack=[]
        curr=0
        sign='+'
        for i, ech in enumerate(s):
            if ech.isdigit():   ### 123= 0*10+1=1, 1*10+2=12, 12*10+3= 123
                curr= curr*10 + int(s[i])
            
            if not ech.isdigit() or i==len(s)-1:
                if sign=='+':
                    stack.append(curr)
                elif sign=='-':
                    stack.append(-curr)
                elif sign=='*':
                    stack.append(stack.pop() * curr)
                elif sign=='/':
                    stack.append(int(stack.pop()/curr))

                sign= ech # set sign to previously encountered one to keep track
                curr=0   # reset curr to calcaute new number after sign operation was performed
            
        return sum(stack)

# time : O(N), N- length of string
# Space : O(N)
