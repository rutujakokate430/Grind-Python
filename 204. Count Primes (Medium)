204. Count Primes (Medium)

Given an integer n, return the number of prime numbers that are strictly less than n.

Example 1:

Input: n = 10
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 prime numbers less than 10, they are 2, 3, 5, 7.
Example 2:

Input: n = 0
Output: 0
Example 3:

Input: n = 1
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

0 <= n <= 5 * 106

class Solution:
    def countPrimes(self, n: int) -> int:
        cnt_primes=0
        for i in range(2, n): # we know what 0 and 1 are not prime
            is_prime= True  # initially set to true
            for j in range(2,i): # check divisibility with every number
                if i%j==0: # if divisible then not prime
                    is_prime= False 
                    break  # break after we find a prime
            
            if is_prime== True:
                cnt_primes+=1
            
        return cnt_primes
