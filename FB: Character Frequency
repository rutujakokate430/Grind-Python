FB: Character Frequency
Complete a function that returns the number of times a given character occurs in the given string.
Note: Please avoid importing libraries like Counter from collections (if using python) to get the correct solution. The interviewer would like to gauge your experience with initializing/populating dictionaries.
Signature
int returnCharNum(string word, char c)
Input
word: a string
c: a character
Note: Assume that the characters are case sensitive (capital letters are interpreted differently than lower case characters).
Output
An int representing the number of occurrences of the input character (c) in the word.
Examples
word: "Mississippi", c: "s"
output: 4 

word: "Rainbow", c: "j" 
output: 0 

word: "Mirror", c: "m"
output: 0

word: "", c: "c"
output: 0 

word: "hello", c: ""
output: 0
Tips: Think about how to solve this without using an imported library, like Counter in collections if using python.

import math
# Add any extra import statements you may need here


# Add any helper functions you may need here


def character_frequency(s, c):
  # Write your code here. NOTE: please do not use collections.counter() in the real interview.
  if not s or not c:
    return 0
  
  freq={}
  for chr in s:
    if chr in freq:
      freq[chr]+=1
    else:
      freq[chr]=1
   
  return freq.get(c, 0)
